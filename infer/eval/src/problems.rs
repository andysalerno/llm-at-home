[WEB_RESULT 0]: Bar del Corso's exemplary pie. Seattle's in the throes of a pizza renaissance, no doubt. But we've always been a town that's serious about its pies and slices, from the mid-aughts Neapolitan heyday to our current deep-dish obsession. However, the best pizza is often the one that's close to home. Here, our favorite New York slices, Sicilian squares, and seasonal sourdough pies across Seattle and beyond.

    [WEB_RESULT 1]: Try the sausage and pistachio pesto pie with hot honey or keep it classic with the pepperoni, made with Ezzo pepperoni that curls up to make cups covered in grease. Open in Google Maps Foursquare. One of the newer entries into Seattle's pizza scene is this naturally leavened dough specialist on Capitol Hill, whose pies have drawn lines on Summit Avenue. The pizzas live up to the hype, especially the one with delightfully crispy pepperoni cups. Open in Google Maps Foursquare. After building a strong following for its naturally leavened sourdough pies as a pop-up, Blotto has set down more permanent roots on Capitol Hill with a cozy restaurant and corner market. While the menu changes often, it's hard to go wrong with the simple cheese pie, with aged mozzarella and just the right amount of grease. For something different, try the pizza made with nduja (spicy, funky, spreadable sausage from Calabria) and kale. It's best to get there on the early side before the shop sells out
    [WEB_RESULT 2]: One might think it's redundant to include Lupo AND Stevie's on the same list, since they're both owned by self-described pizza dorks Shane Abbott and Justin Harcus and since both menus revolve around a naturally fermented sourdough crust. But the two spots are decidedly different. The duo opened Stevie's Famous in late 2022, featuring casual 80s vibes, vintage arcade games, and crispy-as-hell New York-style pizza, a firm departure from the candlelit Neapolitan pies at Lupo's. Crowd faves are the Normie MacDonald, with coppa, burrata, and hot honey, and the classic pep, with both pepperoni cups and nuggets. Open in Google MapsThis low-lit pizza den near the gum wall is easy to overlook (literally, since it's tucked into Post Alley). But after a recent menu revamp and ownership change, with improved doughs and higher quality ingredients has made this low-key Seattle standby one of the best pizzerias in town
