## Exam

The "Exam" is a series of questions, some multi-turn. A model is evaluated against an exam. Its outputs are persisted. Finally, the results are graded by another model request, which provides:

- the questions
- the answer sheet, providing an acceptable answer for each question
- the outputs from the model

And the "proctor" or "grading" model is tasked with scoring the outputs.
