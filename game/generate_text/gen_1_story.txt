You did it, you finally did it!

The machine - the chrono-retrotemporal-resonance-drive - a time machine, basically - works!

All you need to do is enter a code, and it will transport you to another time!

Pick a code: <CODE>

You enter the code, and the machine activates. The smell of ozone fills the room.

And then, suddenly...

...from the smoke filling the room, you hear a (familiar?) voice:

<GEN_1_QUOTE>
Where am I? What in the world is going on?
</GEN_1_QUOTE>

Hold on. You definitely know that voice. The smoke clears, and you see your suspicions were right - it really, truly is:

<GEN_1_NAME>
Einstein
</GEN_1_NAME>

Quit staring!

You explain the situation:

Against all odds, your time machine worked... kind of! It was supposed to send you back in time, but instead it seems to have brought them *forward* in time, to the present day!

Einstein: Intriguing! I must know how it works!
Churchill: All well and good, now send me the hell back!
Dostoyevsky: Most fascinating! You must send me back at once, so I may write about this!

<idea>
2x: There are 3 options for a date, you pick 1
or... instead of 2 dates, there is just 1 date (you pick from 3) and then during the date
there's an event where you pick from 3 again
so two total choices.
2 perfect choices: best end
1 perfect choice: good end
0 perfect choices: bad end
</idea>

You agree, they must be sent back at once.

You reach for the "ACTIVATE" button on the time machine, but as you do, your eyes lock with <NAME>...

BADUMP!

...What was that? That sudden feeling? That warm glow in your chest?

You notice <NAME> blushing.

And you're blushing, too!

Did they feel it too, just now?

...you both shift, uncomfortable in the silence, but also not wanting the moment to end.

Einstein: You know... Perhaps I should stay... this could be a great opportunity for me... for my research on relativity, of course...
