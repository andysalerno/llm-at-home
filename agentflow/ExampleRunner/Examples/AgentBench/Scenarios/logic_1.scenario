I have a zuppy! The zuppy is red. I trade the zuppy for seven flippers. I trade three of the flippers for a smindle. The smindle is purple. I trade the smindle for eight smurkles. Each smurkle is one of the following colors: red, blue, or green. I trade two red smurkles for a flump. The flump is the same color as the smindle was. What color is the flump?
