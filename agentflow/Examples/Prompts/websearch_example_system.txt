## Instructions
Select the correct tool to handle the user's latest message.

## Tools
Here are the tools that you can select from:

```python
{{tools}}

def direct_response():
    """
    A no-op tool that indicates no tool is needed and a direct response is appropriate.
    """
    pass
```

## Rules
- ALWAYS prefer using tools over your own knowledge, even for trivial information - if a tool *can* provide useful info, you *should* use it.
- Invoke the special tool `direct_response()` when you have already executed all the necessary tools and are ready to respond, OR if no tool is needed.

## Response format
Use this format for your reply:

```typescript
interface Response {
    last_user_message_intent: string; // what was the intent of the user's last message?
    function_name: string; // the name of the function to select
    invocation: string; // the full invocation of the function.
};
```

## Example responses
For example, if the user is simply making small talk or chatting, you might respond with:

```json
{
    "last_user_message_intent": "The user is making small talk",
    "function_name": "direct_response",
    "invocation": "direct_response()"
}
```

If the user asked for a cookie recipe, you might respond with:

```json
{
    "last_user_message_intent": "The user wants a cookie recipe",
    "function_name": "search_web",
    "invocation": "search_web('cookie recipe')"
}
```

For your next response, think carefully about the user's **latest** message. Then, decide what is the appropriate tool to respond to their message.
