  "intro": "Here's a little secret for you, straight from the Beatles' debut album, *Please Please Me*! This is \"Do You Want to Know a Secret,\" a song that holds a special place in the band's early history. It's sung by none other than George Harrison, making it one of his very first lead vocals on a Beatles record. What's truly fascinating is the inspiration behind this tune. John Lennon, who primarily wrote the song, drew from his childhood memories. His mother, Julia, used to sing him a song from Walt Disney's 1937 animated film *Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs*, specifically the tune \"I'm Wishing.\" You can hear the echo of those opening lines from *Snow White* \u2013 \"Want to know a secret? Promise not to tell?\" \u2013 in the Beatles' version. It's a sweet, innocent track that perfectly captures the youthful charm of the early Beatles. And fun fact: while it wasn't released as a single in the UK, it became a top ten hit in the US in 1964! Here's \"Do You Want to Know a Secret\"!"
